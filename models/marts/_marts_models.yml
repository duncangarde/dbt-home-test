        description: "The average amount a customer transacts in a 'full' month. Note:\n\n
          This is only calculated for full months (where we have a full months worth of transaction data)
          because otherwise we would skew the average down if we included partial months as we would not
          give enough time for the customer to complete all their transactions.\n
          Also instead of trying to project for partial months we are conservative and just use full months"

          This is important to read in conjuction with the data. For example 'transaction_amount_total'
          and 'transaction_total_percentage_change' can be misleading for a partial month"

      - name: transaction_total_percentage_change
        description: "The percentage change in total transactions amount compared to the previous month.
          0 would be exactly the same as last month. Positive is growth from last month, and negative
          is when the amount is smaller than last month. Notes:\n\n
          We are only computing for months where we have a previous month of data. Instead of assuming zero
          for other months we are leaving them as null to show we have no data"
